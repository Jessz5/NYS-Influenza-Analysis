# NYS Influenza Analysis

## Project Overview
The NYS Influenza Analysis project is a comprehensive exploration of influenza data in New York State during the initial months of the 2023-2024 season, specifically from October to December 2023. It aims to uncover key insights into the influenza outbreak, shedding light on various aspects such as case trends, hospitalizations, and demographic patterns.

### Key Objectives
1. **Understand Case Dynamics:** Analyze the trends and patterns of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases across different regions of New York State.

2. **Hospitalization Insights:** Investigate influenza-related hospitalizations, including identifying high-impact regions and age groups.

3. **Demographic Breakdown:** Explore the distribution of cases and hospitalizations among different age groups to understand demographic variations.

### Components of the Analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** A detailed examination of the datasets to uncover patterns, outliers, and trends related to influenza cases and hospitalizations.

- **Data Cleaning:** Rigorous cleaning of the datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability in the subsequent analysis.

- **Visualizations:** Utilization of visualizations, including graphs and charts, to present key findings in an accessible and informative manner.
